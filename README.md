# Polla

Create and Take Polls with Ease.

## Database

Polla uses [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) as its database.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
